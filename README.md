## Introduction:
This game is made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game features 3 buttons: rock, paper, and scissors. Each is identifiable through the emojis on the button and the subtitles underneath. Anytime you press a button, the program will also automate the computer to choose a random move. The player's score against the computer is tracked in a paragraph statement below the button. Finally, on the left side of the screen, a picture of a real hand is generated to match both you and the computer's respective moves.
